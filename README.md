# Chandramuke-task4
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression with Scikit-learn. Use a binary dataset, split into train/test sets, and standardize features. Fit the model and evaluate using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Explore threshold tuning and explain the sigmoid function's role in probability prediction.
